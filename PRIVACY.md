# Privacy Policy

This document explains how the ZTD CLI Task Manager collects, stores, and handles your data.

---

## Data Collected

ZTD **does not** collect data remotely or transmit it over the internet.  
All data you enter is stored **locally on your computer** in two files:

- `tasks.json` — Stores active tasks
- `done_tasks.json` — Stores completed tasks

---

## Storage Method

By default, tasks are stored as **plain text JSON**. This format is human-readable and easily editable, but it is **not secure**. Anyone with access to your computer can view these files.

If you wish to protect your stored tasks, please see our [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) guide for instructions on encrypting your files.

---

## Data Deletion

You may delete your data at any time by:

- Using the `delete` command inside ZTD to remove tasks
- Manually deleting the `tasks.json` and/or `done_tasks.json` files

---

## Backups

ZTD does not automatically back up your data.  
If you want to preserve your tasks, make manual copies of your task files or use a secure backup system.

---

## User Responsibility

It is your responsibility to:

- Avoid storing highly sensitive personal data unless you have implemented encryption
- Keep your computer and ZTD files secure from unauthorised access
- Back up your task data if needed
